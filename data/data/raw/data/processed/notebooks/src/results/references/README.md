# Disease Risk Prediction ML

## Project Overview
This project explores disease risk prediction using machine learning and probabilistic modeling. The goal is to build data-driven models to predict disease risk based on bioscience datasets.

## Repository Structure
- `data/raw/` - Original datasets  
- `data/processed/` - Cleaned and processed datasets  
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for analysis and experimentation  
- `src/` - Python scripts and functions  
- `results/` - Graphs, model outputs, and tables  
- `references/` - Research papers, links, and PDFs  

## Research Interests
Biosciences, data-centric sciences, computational statistics, probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and AI.
